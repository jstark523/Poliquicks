# Poliquicks
## Description
This ios app's goal is to improve political transparency especially on a local level.

I noticed that there is no political app that is widely used by people of my demographics.
I also noticed that people around me say that they only vote along their party lines, especially for local politicians that they don't know much about.

This is damaging, especially since local politicans have the most impact on us as individuals. 
By relying on party politics, and not being informed, we cannot hold representatives accountable in any way.

My proposed solution to this problem is Poliquicks. 

A simple, clear, concise app, that shows information about politicians from a local to more federal level.
